# Code Samples

I've rearranged things a little bit to allow for more samples. Links are below.

## C# Samples:
[BootCamp LiveProject](ASPNET_MVC_App.md): This was an ASP.NET MVC webapp made for a local theater group in Portland, OR. I worked with a group of developers for two weeks doing some back and front end stories. Being 2020, we worked remotely and used video chats for our scrums.

[Sudoku solving web app](Sudoku_Solver.md): MVC web app that solves sudoku puzzles. This was a side project of mine just for extra study while I was in boot camp.


## Python Sample:

[Chess Fan Site](django_chessapp.md): At the end of my Python course in boot camp, I got to work with a team of developers on a Django web app. A web app in Django made as part of a larger collection. I worked with a group of developers for two weeks, being 2020, we worked remotely and used video chats for our scrums.
