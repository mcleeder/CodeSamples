# Boot Camp Live Projects


## Introduction

At The Tech Academy, for the last two weeks in every language program we work in teams on a shared project. In the C# program, that app was an ASP.NET MVC site for a local theater group. It being Covid-time, we worked remotely. We used Slack, Google Meet, and daily scrum meetings to maintain group cohesion.  was able to work on several front end and back end stories.
