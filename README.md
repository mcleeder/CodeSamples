# Code Samples


## C# Samples:
[Internship Project: Theatre Company](https://github.com/mcleeder/TheatreCompany/): This was an ASP.NET MVC webapp made for a local theater group in Portland, OR. I worked with a group of developers for two weeks doing some back and front end stories. Being 2020, we worked remotely and used video chats for our scrums.

[Sudoku solving web app](https://github.com/mcleeder/SudokuSolverWebApp/blob/master/README.md): MVC web app that solves sudoku puzzles. This was a side project of mine just for extra study while I was in boot camp.


## Python Sample:

[Internship Project: Chess Fan Site](https://github.com/mcleeder/ChessFanSite/): This was a little sub-app I wrote with a team of developers working on a Django web app during an internship at Prosper IT Consulting. I worked with a group of developers for two weeks, being 2020, we worked remotely and used video chats for our scrums.
