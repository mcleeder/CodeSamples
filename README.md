# Code Samples


## C# Samples:
[Internship Project: Theatre Company](https://github.com/mcleeder/TheatreCompany/): This was an ASP.NET MVC webapp made for a local theater group in Portland, OR. I worked with a group of developers for two weeks doing some back and front end stories. Being 2020, we worked remotely and used video chats for our scrums.

[Sudoku solving web app](https://github.com/mcleeder/SudokuSolverWebApp/blob/master/README.md): MVC web app that solves sudoku puzzles. This was a side project of mine just for extra study while I was in boot camp.


## Python Samples:

[Internship Project: Chess Fan Site](https://github.com/mcleeder/ChessFanSite/): This was a little sub-app I wrote with a team of developers working on a Django web app during an internship at Prosper IT Consulting. I worked with a group of developers for two weeks, being 2020, we worked remotely and used video chats for our scrums.

[File Lookup & Rename Script](ISBN_file_rename.ipynb): My partner is a freelance editor. One of her clients asked her to pick up a task to rename over 500 image files from file names using their SKU to using their ISBN. There were a lot of files, even with robot-like focus it would have taken an entire day. I wrote this script to handle the task instead. Basically, it did some parsing of the file names to pull out the Product Code. Then it used that code to look up the ISBN number in a spreadsheet and then wrote that as the filename. Plus some extra logic for missing ISBNs and pairs of images. I used Jupyter Notebook for development and Pandas to load and query the Excel reference file.
