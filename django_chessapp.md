# Chess Fan Site


## Introduction

At The Tech Academy, for the last two weeks in every language program we work in teams on a shared project. In the Python program, that app was an Django site for housing personal collections and hobbies. It being Covid-time, we worked remotely. We used Slack, Google Meet, and daily scrum meetings to maintain group cohesion.

Main logic:

-[The checker](https://github.com/mcleeder/CodeSamples/blob/main/Sudoku_Solver.md#the-checker)
