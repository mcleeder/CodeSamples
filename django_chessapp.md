# Chess Fan Site


## Introduction

At The Tech Academy, for the last two weeks in every language program we work in teams on a shared project. In the Python program, that app was an Django site for housing personal collections and hobbies. It being Covid-time, we worked remotely. We used Slack, Google Meet, and daily scrum meetings to maintain group cohesion.

A lot of the coding was just setting up models and views in django. If you want to see the whole show, you can [click here](https://github.com/mcleeder/ChessFanSite/tree/main/ChessApp). Following that link will take you to the code I worked on for the site, but not the entire site itself.

Main logic:

-[Chess.com API Request](https://github.com/mcleeder/CodeSamples/blob/main/django_chessapp.md#Chess.com-API-Request)

-[The checker](https://github.com/mcleeder/CodeSamples/blob/main/Sudoku_Solver.md#the-checker)
